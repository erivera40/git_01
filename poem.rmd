I think that I shall never see  
A poem lovely as a tree.  

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest  
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;  

A tree that looks at God all day,  
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;  

A tree that may in summer wear  
A nest of robins in her hair;  

Upon whose bosom snow has lain;  
Who intimately lives with rain.  

Poems are made by fools like me,  
But only God can make a tree.
